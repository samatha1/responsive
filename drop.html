            <p>For years, Maangalya Shopping Mall has been the household name offering a special range for every occasion. With several stores, it has a wide reach with sprawling showrooms in Warangal, Karimnagar, Siddipet and Hanmakonda. We have recently expanded our reach to the City of Pearls - Hyderabad. Our showrooms at Madeenaguda, Boduppal, Vanasthalipuram and Kukatpally offer ‘Special’ collections of sarees, ethnic wear and trendy apparels for Men, Women and Kids.
               Maangalya logo is crafted in the shape of a petal. The red and yellow colours in the logo are considered as pious. While the colour ‘Yellow’ symbolizes prosperity and opulence, ‘Red’ stands for strength, auspiciousness and fertility.
               The name Maangalya is associated with something auspicious, pure and beautiful. The mention of ‘Maangalya’ can be found in the Kavya Literature where the word is referred to as ‘conferring happiness.’ The word ‘Maangalya’ can also be found in Unati Sutra, where it connotes welfare and propitiousness.
               …This is what Maangalya Shopping Mall stands for.</p>
